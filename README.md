# minigame-thing-i-made
okay so this is a simple game where bricks fall from the top of the screen and the player has to catch them to get points, moving sideways with the left and right arrow keys.
There isnt a set goal or way to end the game other than manually at the time
Everything was using basic built in 3D models, recycled code from previous projects with some tweaks, and instructions from Unity Learn.
I couldn't think of an appropriate title.
